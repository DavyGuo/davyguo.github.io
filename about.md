Hello! My name is Weifeng Guo. My friends call me Davy.
I've graduated from Clemson University back in 2014. After that I've worked in Chicago and Beijing.
After several years' work in logistics business, I've decided to take a further step in career by learning some new tricks.
Hopefully I would survive.

### More Information

I'd like doing exercise and watching movies. But now I barely have time for these other than learning :)
